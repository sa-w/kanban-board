# Pragmatic board

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/alexreardon/pragmatic-board)

A board example powered by [Pragmatic drag and drop](https://github.com/atlassian/pragmatic-drag-and-drop) that leverages shadows for drop placement (like [Trello](https://trello.com/)).

This project is a [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) site that leverages [react](https://react.dev/), [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) (for styling) and [lucide](https://lucide.dev/) (for icons).

This example does not implement the [Pragmatic drag and drop accessibility guidelines](https://atlassian.design/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/accessibility-guidelines) in order to keep this code simpler.

## Running locally

This is fairly vanilla `next.js` project, so you can use all the `next.js` commands directly.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
